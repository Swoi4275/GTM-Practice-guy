# Simple HTML and CSS Web Application for GTM and Google Analytics Practice

## About The Project

This project consists of a simple web application with three pages, designed to help understand and implement Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager (GTM) for tracking purposes. The core idea is to create an environment where beginners can learn how to track user interactions, such as button clicks and navigation between pages, as well as understand how variables within GTM are tracked across a website.

### Why This Project Is Useful

This project serves as a hands-on practice ground for those new to web analytics, specifically focusing on Google's tools. It aims to demystify the process of setting up tracking on a website, providing a clear example of how GTM can be utilized to gather meaningful data about user behavior. By exploring the implementation within a controlled, simple environment, users can better understand the principles of web analytics, making it easier to apply these concepts to more complex sites or applications.
